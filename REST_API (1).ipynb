    "# REST API Design \n",
    "It is firstly important to note that if this functionality were to be deployed into a production environment we would use a database such as mongoDB, especially since this service works with JSON documents. For the purpose of simplicity and getting this challenge done on time I have decided to simply use a dictionary in the place of the database. The reason for selecting a dictionary as my data structure is the fact that the key-value pairs are very similar to how a database is queried. Here instead a query can be carried out by looking up the key. To create this service I have used Flask, which is excellent for developing web applications. I have aimed to implement the different methods with the correct HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE in order to create a functioning service. My aim was to approach this as if it were a product and therefore thought of all the items a user would require when using the API to classify data samples in real-time I have implemented the following functionalities to illustrate how this API could be utilized effectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1.</b> Classify new samples using the selected Machine Learning algorithm (POST).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2.</b> Get the name of the Machine Leanring Algorithm currently being utilisex by the API (GET).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3.</b> Allow the algorithm to be retrained on a new batch of data (POST).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>4.</b> Change the Machine Learning Algorithm being used (POST).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>5.</b> Return all of the data in the database (GET).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>6.</b> Update the data for a specified sample index in the database (PUT).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>7.</b> Delete the data at a specified sample index in the database (DELETE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these has been implemented above however, there are also many other items that could be seen as desirable for such an API. They key here is to enable functionality in order to reduce downtime of the service. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1.</b> Allow for the data at a specified sample index to be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2.</b> The implementation of some form of authentification would be highly desirable e.g. Authorization or API keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3.</b> The ability to completely wipe all the data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>4.</b> The ability for more advanced database searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>5.</b> Reboot the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is finally worth noting that I have aimed to use the HTTP error codes where possible as a means of detection errors in my testing but I am sure a different system would be applicable if this were to be a production system."
