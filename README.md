# Genesys Coding Challenge
This is my approach to a coding challenge for a job interview at Genesys. The tasks were as follows:
1. Perform Exploratory Dataset Analysis, cleaning and visualization on the dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/kondla/carinsurance
2. Train and evaluate a Machine Learning Algorithm on the dataset.
3. Create a REST Service that will use the trained model to make real-time predictions on new data samples.
